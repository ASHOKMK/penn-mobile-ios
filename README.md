NOTE: this repo requires [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) and [Crashlytics](https://www.crashlytics.com/dashboard) to work correctly. Please install both and always open the .xcworkspace file rather than the .xcodeproj file. 

TODO:
------

1. Make "Menu" button return to original view if the menu is present
2. Make navigation bar text blue instead of white in the address book view controller
3. Add more news sources?
4. Lock background views when the loading indicator is shown
